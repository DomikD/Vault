[[Mitsuri Hayashi]] was trained in the art of archery, Kyudou. She was an amazing shot, she could hit someone all the way from the other side of the battlefield. 




[[Mitsuri Hayashi]] had been fighting in the war since 3286. 

At her camp, she left gold that was intended for her brothers. Her bow had engraved the following:

Her fellow soldiers gathered some money, her bow and sent it back.















## Background

The only woman he ever got along with was his [[Mitsuri Hayashi]], which left to join the army when he was around 8. She would come back now and then, each time her expression turning grimmer. One day would a soldier would appear in her stead, saying she didn't make it. While he suspected suspect a day like this might come, it didn't hurt any less. He hated how some of his family seemed to be comforted as he went on and on about how she served the country.

Well, I was thinking what kind of family was this? Not a great one. In reality, his sister didn't "didn't make it," but ==committed suicide== instead. She would return to her family seeking any kind of help she could get, but it didn't help. The exact reason she did it isn't that important, though many would apply.

Without others knowing, the soldier handed my character ==a sack of coins==. A rather big one, most likely all of his sister's savings. Whatever happened must have made the soldier ==sour enough not to steal any==, or at least not too much.

It would be what funded his leave to pursue the monastery

Still, that doesn't answer what are his goals. As years passed, he noticed there was something off about the way his sister had acted and slowly realized he could've done something. For all he knows, ==she still would've died on a battlefield, but maybe he could've made her living years more bearable==.

==He wants to have something to protect==. Have something that will make him feel as if he's needed. He doesn't know what, or who that would be, but he figured learning to protect first wouldn't hurt.

The worst he would think would be that her bad mood rendered her unable to concentrate in battle

While he didn't express it out loud, my father would barely give me any attention. It would be as if by pretending I didn't exist he could lie to himself mom was still alive. ==He would eventually get a new partner, but it would be too late==.
