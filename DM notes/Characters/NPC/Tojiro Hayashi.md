Tojiro was an abusive men who didn't care about many things, and when he did, it most likely revolved around him. Wake up, go to work, wind down with some gambling and sake, in rare occasion company of a woman, and go back to sleep. What about the kids? Well, they should be grateful he gives them something to eat. It's not his fault his wife had died and that there wasn't anyone to raise them. Depending on who bothered him during his free time, and what was the state of his soberty, he could raise a hand against them.
Things were better before Ren was born, but after his mother died all the self-destructive tendencies of Tojiro got worse.
