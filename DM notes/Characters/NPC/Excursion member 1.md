Brother Kaelor possesses seemingly all-knowing eyes adorned by a friendly, and wrinkly face. He's been around long enough for most people to know him. He spends a decent chunk of his day meditating and is always ready to lend people his wisdom. He has written a book and enjoys poetry. He approaches every situation with a tranquil demeanor and encourages the group to find peace amid chaos. His unwavering composure is a source of inspiration for those around him, making him a natural leader in times of crisis.
Kaelor wanted to stretch out his old bones as he put it, and was eager to travel. In truth, a part of the reason was because his favorite author was from the region of the excursion.
During the trip he and Ren became somewhat closer. Before the old man had seemed like an ancient tree; a sight to behold, but not something to interact with.
