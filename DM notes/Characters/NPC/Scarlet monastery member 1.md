Ren considered Asahi somewhat of a father figure where his father had failed him. The older men had been in the monetary for longer than Ren have lived. He loved to tell stories of his discoveries, especially one in which he claimed to have outsmarted a young wyrmling. Most of them had *some* truth to them, and when his story proved to be wrong he simply claimed he got the detail wrong and blamed his old memory. Asahi had small loops in his earlobes and a slowly greying beard, his hair kept short.
