Sister Elira stands out with her bleached hair which she keeps in a top knot.  She is known for her unshakable determination and getting into trouble with authority, but is also considered to have a heart of gold. She sets her sights on a goal and pursues it with relentless vigor. Her passion lies in a hand to hand duels as well as music.
She's the most socially capable person Ren knows, but that doesn't stop him from being awkward around her. He still remembers the one time where he spilled tea over them both, and as he hurried over to grab something to dry them off, he broke a different cup. While she didn't seem to mind, Ren's pride has never recovered.
