#History  #VrikshaRajya

In the middle of the [[Locations/Continent/1. Vriksha Rajya/Vriksha Rajya]], lies a tree that spans the continent. The tree's roots are visible from on the roads and the native people have decided to take it as waymarkers, making getting lost harder. Cities are found around the roots and have cleverly used the big roots to their advantage. One city uses the loop that the root has made as their city walls. Up above there are lights that are visible. Aside from that, it is possible to move under the root to go inside the city.
