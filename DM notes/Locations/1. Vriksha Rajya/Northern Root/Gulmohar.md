#Location #Town 

[[Gulmohar]] is a small town that lies on the [[Northern Root]]. While not in the area in the same living space as the village, closeby there is a forest called the [[Forest of flames]]. 

The village is not known for much besides their oracles, like [[Divya]]. 



### Name origin

Gulmohar is the name of a tree that is native to India and is known for its vibrant red flowers. It could be a fitting name for a small village in a D&D setting, especially if the village is located near a grove of these trees. The name also has a pleasant ring to it and is easy to pronounce, making it a good choice for players to remember.
