[[Island 5]] is subdivided into 2 inhabited areas: the [[Scarlet monastery]] and lower lands. Despite its close vicinity to the [[Mahilaya Archipelago]], there isn't a lot of trade. This is due to the mountains that close off the East. This makes it hard to board. It is generally preferred to embark on [[Renkajima]]. 

At the foot of those mountains, one can find a monastery which holds a group of monks known as the [[Order of the Scarlet Sun]]. The are cliffs and mountains on the east, preventing easy access from the [[Indonesian & Filipino sea]]. In general, the climb to the [[Scarlet monastery]] is quite hard. 

The lay of the land means that the only ones that live there are in the [[Scarlet monastery]]. Aside from that, there are those who convey news to the monks. 


On the edge of [[Island 5]], there is an embassy of [[Xianhua]].
